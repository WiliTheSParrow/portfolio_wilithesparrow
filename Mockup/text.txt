My Intoduction:

Hi! I'm Julia.
Wife, cat mom and horror movie lover. Of course I like coffee.
Currently, I'm working at BusinessMonitor as Front-end Designer. In my spare time you'll find me on concerts, travelling OR home knitting and crocheting while watching some spooky stuff.
I learned Web Development and Web Design by myself. I'm very passionate about making the digital world a more "candy for the eye" place. Not to mention making it more user friendly.
Do you agree with my mission? Then contact me!
